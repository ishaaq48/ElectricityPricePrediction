# Electricity Price Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for electricity prices. Accurate electricity price predictions are essential for various stakeholders in the energy sector, enabling them to make informed decisions about electricity consumption, pricing strategies, and resource allocation. The model is designed to provide forecasts of future electricity prices based on historical data and external factors.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/ishaaq48/ElectricityPricePrediction.git)
## Install the required Python libraries:
      pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage
## To use this project:

Ensure you have installed the required libraries as described in the "Installation" section.

Prepare your dataset following the project's data format requirements.

Train the electricity price prediction model using your dataset. You may use the provided Jupyter notebook or Python scripts for training.

Make predictions for future electricity prices based on your trained model.

Evaluate the model's performance using the metrics described in the project documentation.

## Data
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes historical electricity price data. It may also include relevant external factors like weather conditions, demand, and supply data, which can influence electricity prices.

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset preprocessing steps involve cleaning, transformation, feature engineering, and data normalization/scaling. Refer to the project documentation for detailed information on data preprocessing.

## Model
The project uses the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model for time series forecasting. ARIMA is chosen for its ability to capture complex time series patterns by considering autoregressive, differencing, and moving average components.

## Evaluation
## The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Additional metrics may be considered based on specific project requirements.
